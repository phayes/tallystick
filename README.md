# TallyMan

TallyMan is a work-in-progress rust library for tallying votes in an election.

*Current state is very unstable. It is not currently recommended for use. See checkboxes below for a list of features that are complete.*

## Goals
1. **Fast** - Be the fastest general-purpose vote tallying library in the world.
2. **Secure** - Have no undefined behavior. 
3. **Complete** - Support all well-known voting methods.
4. **Deterministic** - Running the same tally twice should never produce different results.

## Features
- [ ] `no_std` for embedded use.
- [ ] `wasm` support for use in the browser, or in blockchain chaincode.
